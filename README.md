# classification-tweets
Collecting tweets is done by the code of Motaz Saad(https://github.com/layanilamani/motazsaad-comparable-text-miner)

Appling Machine learning algorithms is studied from ali7amdi(https://github.com/ali7amdi/Python-for-Data-Science-Course)

The key words list is avalibale on seperate file.

Data set include tweets_id with two coders label is in Tweets_ID_with_Labels.csv

Saving the tweets in csv file with the label of coder 1

Code of calculate inter-coder Railability between two coders is in inter-coder.py

Code of compare the 4 machine learning algorithims with featuers is in all_applay_accuracy.py

code of applay the 4 machine learning algorithims with POS feuter is in POS applay.py

code of applay the 4 machine learning algorithims with balance is in balance applay accuracy.py

code of applay the 4 machine learning algorithims with bio feuter is in bio applay.py
